# üß† MIND Data Standard

**MIND (Multimodal Interoperable N Dimensional)** is an open data standard for representing, synchronising, and sharing high-fidelity behavioural and physiological datasets across experiments.

This repository contains the **core specification**, **schemas**, and **examples** defining the MIND standard.  
It provides a structured framework for recording multimodal, irregular timeseries data from XR applications and biosensors.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions to the MIND specification are welcome from researchers, developers, and organisations working in neuroscience, cognitive science, XR, and related domains.

We encourage discussion through **GitHub Issues** and **Pull Requests**.  
If you find something unclear, inconsistent, or incomplete ‚Äî please open an issue with as much context as possible.

### üß© How to Contribute

1. **Open an Issue**  
   Describe the proposed change, addition, or clarification.  
   Link to relevant sections of the specification or examples if possible.

2. **Fork and Edit**  
   Create a branch from `main`, make your proposed edits in the relevant Markdown or schema files, and commit with clear messages.

3. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   Include a short summary of your changes and the reasoning behind them.  
   Pull requests are reviewed by maintainers and subject-matter experts before being merged.

4. **Extensions and Experimental Fields**  
   The MIND specification supports extensions for specific research domains or modalities (e.g., haptics, eye-tracking).  
   If you are developing an extension, please prefix its schema with `mindx-` and submit a proposal for review.

Before contributing, please read the [Governance Guidelines](GOVERNANCE.md) and [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the decision process, review stages, and extension approval.

## üß† Governance

The MIND standard is coordinated by **SilicoLabs**, in consultation with an advisory network of researchers and partners.  
The goal is to maintain transparency, interoperability, and community stewardship of the specification.

### Decision Process
- Minor editorial fixes are merged after review by one maintainer.  
- Substantive changes or new features require a public discussion period and approval by two maintainers.  
- Major version releases (e.g., 1.0 ‚Üí 2.0) include formal review and community feedback.

Versioned releases are archived on **Zenodo** and receive a DOI for citation.

For more details, see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).
